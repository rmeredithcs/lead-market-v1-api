    "description": "The Lead Market API allows you to:\n- Create and update leads to sell via Lead Market.\n- Manage blacklists to avoid buying specific leads.\n- Provide progress updates and outcomes for purchased leads.\n- Retrieve the status or details of a lead.\n- Request delivery of the Credit Sense report for a bought lead.\n- Update the reference for a lead's Credit Sense application.\n\n### About these API docs\nThese API docs are provided in OpenAPI Specification (OAS) format for your reference. Use the `Download` button atop this page to download these API docs as an OAS 3-compliant JSON document that you can import into the API client of your choice (e.g. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), [Swagger Inspector](https://inspector.swagger.io/builder)).\n\nYou can also click one of the buttons below to import the API spec into an API client you have installed.\n\n[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/da63c952ac2450a1701c)\n[![Run in Insomnia}](https://insomnia.rest/images/run.svg)](https://insomnia.rest/run/?label=Lead%20Market%20API&uri=https%3A%2F%2Fapi-docs.creditsense.com.au%2Flead-market%2Fv1%2FLead-Market-API.v1.json)\n\nClick the chevrons next to object names and response codes to expand out the request and response schemas.\n![alt text](https://rmeredithcs.github.io/lead-market-v1-api/API_docs_guide.gif \"API docs guide screen recording\")\n\n### Request URL\nThe request URL is built using multiple components - `{protocol}` `{base-url}` `{version}` `{api-key}` `{endpoint}`\n1. All calls to the API must be made using the TLS **protocol** - `https://`\n2. The **base URL** is always [api.leadmarketonline.com](api.leadmarketonline.com) - `https://api.leadmarketonline.com`\n3. The current **version** is v1 - `https://api.leadmarketonline.com/v1`\n4. The **API key** will be unique to your environment - `https://api.leadmarketonline.com/v1/xxx-xxx-xxx`\n5. The **endpont** will be determined by what you're trying to do - `https://api.leadmarketonline.com/v1/xxx-xxx-xxx/exampleEndpoint`\n\n### Authentication\nEach call to the API requires:\n- **API key** - identifies your account; forms part of the request URL.\n- **API token** - identifies your access to the API; included in the `Settings` object in your request body.\n\nIf you don't have your API credentials or you'd like them to be changed, please [contact us](mailto:support@leadmarketonline.com).\n\n### Rate Limiting *****IS THIS A THING ON LEAD MARKET?*****\nThe API is rate limited at one API call per second, with the ability to handle a burst of up to 20 API calls depending on the amount of API credits available.\n\n#### How do API credits work?\n- Every API call uses an API credit. \n- Your account receives one API credit every one second and can accrue a maximum of 20 credits at any time.\n- When your API credits run out the API will return a '429 - Too Many Requests' status code, indicating that you will need to retry your API call after waiting for your API credit balance to increase.",

If we do not receive a `200` response, we will retry your callback URL for a couple of minutes.\n\nThe delay between attempts is increased exponentially following every failed attempt until three retries are exhausted.\n\n| Retry | Delay                       | Total time since first delivery attempt |\n|-------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| 1     | 3 seconds                   | 3 seconds                               |\n| 2     | 15 seconds                  | 18 seconds                              |\n| 3     | 75 seconds                  | 93 seconds                              |",

This is not done to intentionally make Buyer integrations difficult. Rather, when a Seller is passing in details via the API it’s generally due to the lead not being engaged at the time. The stance we take on this is _it’s better to have some data that **may** be invalid, than no data_. A good example is when a lead provides a valid mobile number, but they enter it in the email address field of a Seller’s website. If the Seller's form doesn't validate the data and passes it through to Lead Market, we'll accept it. We’ll provide the raw values to the Buyer, and we’ll also provided validated contact details in the `$..V_Contact_Type` and `$..V_Contact_Value` fields. We've found this approach provides the best outcome and richer lead data sets for Buyers.",
